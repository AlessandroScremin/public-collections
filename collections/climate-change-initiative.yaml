Name: climate_change_initiative
Description: |
  ESA's Climate Change Initiative provides Climate Data Records (CDRs) for Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) 
  generated from the long-term global EO archives. As it stands, the programme offers 22 ECVs with 413 datasets and a 
  multiple of single parameters. In EDC, the data can be conveniently accessed via the xcube datastore for 
  CCI'c Open Data Portal.
