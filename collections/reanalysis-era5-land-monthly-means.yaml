Name: ERA5-Land monthly averaged data
Description: |
 [The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)](https://www.ecmwf.int/) produces ERA5-Land dataset within the frame of 
 [Copernicus Climate Change Service](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/copernicus-services/climate-change).
 ERA5-Land is a replay of the land component of the ERA5 climate reanalysis with a finer native resolution of 9km compared to 31km in ERA5 and an improved
 computational efficiency. The data in the [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.1x0.1 degrees.
 ERA5-Land dataset describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period. 
 By combining model data and observations that goes back several decades in time, reanalysis provides an accurate description of the climate of the past.
 ERA5-Land monthly averaged data is a post-processed subset of the full ERA5-Land dataset representing pre-calculated monthly-mean averages
 to facilitate quick and easy access when sub-monthly data is not required. 
 The temporal and spatial resolutions of ERA5-Land makes it very useful for land surface monitoring applications such as flood or drought forecasting.
