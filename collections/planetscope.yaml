Name: PlanetScope
Description: |
  [PlanetScope](https://www.planet.com/products/planet-imagery/) is a satellite constellation of more than 130 satellites called Doves and is operated by Planet. 
  Each Dove satellite is a CubeSat made of three cubic units and thus measures only 10 cm x 10 cm x 30 cm. 
  The satellites are launched in groups, and together manage to acquire images covering the entire earth land surface atleast daily.
  Sentinel Hub offers a possibility to purchase, order and access PlanetScope both archive and newly acquired data which is available globally since 2016.
  Sentinel Hub offers access to PlantScope data in Top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance.
