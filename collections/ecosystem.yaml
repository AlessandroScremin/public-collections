Name: Ecosystem Map of Hungary
Description: |
  The Ecosystem Map of Hungary shows the distribution, extent and frequency of ecosystem types on national-scale. Although, mapping of agricultural and urban ecosystems was also a goal, the primary target areas of mapping were semi-natural areas. The map is suitable to serve as the basis of all further assessments of Ecosystem Services and green infrastructure. 
  Top-down and bottom-up mapping approaches were combined to execute mapping, relying both on existing and regularly updated thematic databases and remote sensing images.
  The map was created within the frame of an EU-co-financed project: "Strategic Assessments supporting the long-term conservation of natural values of community interest as well as the national implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020". (KEHOP-4.3.0-VEKOP-15-2016-00001).
