Name: Field Delineation
BYOAID: field-delineation
Description: |
  An algorithm for automatic delineation of agricultural field boundaries from Sentinel-2 imagery.
  
  The main part of the algorithm is an advanced pre-trained machine learning model. It was trained on multiple locations throughout Europe for a time interval from March to August.
  
  The algorithm is an improved version of the one developed for [NIVA project](https://www.niva4cap.eu/). More information about the process is available in a [blog post](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/parcel-boundary-detection-for-cap-2a316a77d2f6) and in a recording of a [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czRCApJCYIo).
  
  To run the field delineation process, navigate to [EDC Browser](https://browser.eurodatacube.com/?zoom=6&lat=47.44295&lng=10.71167&algorithm=field-delineation), 
  select the required input parameters and follow the check-out wizard to complete your order. Produced data will be uploaded directly into your JupyterLab environment on EDC.
