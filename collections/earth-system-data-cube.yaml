Name: Earth System Data Cube v2.1.1
Description: |
  Earth System Data Cube v2.1.1 is a result of the project Earth System Data Lab, which is now continued as Deep
  Earth System Data Lab (DeepESDL). It contains relevant variables for Earth System Science, mostly derived from Earth 
  Observation, but the compilation also includes model or re-analysis data. There are two resolutions available and for 
  each resolution a differently chunked version.The DeepESDL project is very grateful to all data owners for kindly 
  providing the data sets free of charge. They come without any warranty, neither from the owners, 
  the DeepESDL team or ESA.
